=================

Demo of Bonita + Vaadin integration (i.e. brush up small parts of an application) via HTML5 postMessage

<b>Situation:</b> You have an existing, grown application

<b>Problem:</b> Every change is a nightmare, but you can't just replace the application as a whole

<b>Remedy: </b> Replace one screen at a time: use an iFrame for the new screen and have it communicate with the rest. Get a little better every day. 

This demo app shows just that with a bonita process as the "old" application and a Vaadin replacement for one screen
